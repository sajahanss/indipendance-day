        <h1>Independence Day 2024: History And Significance</h1>
        <p>The roots of India’s Independence Day trace back to the relentless efforts of freedom fighters and leaders who dedicated their lives to liberate the nation from the British colonial rule. On August 15, 1947, India emerged as a free nation, ending nearly 200 years of British dominance. Indians celebrate this day each year to celebrate the end of British colonial rule and the birth of an independent India. The historic moment was marked by Jawaharlal Nehru’s iconic speech, “Tryst with Destiny,” delivered at the stroke of midnight, marking the beginning of a new era.</p>
        <p>Independence day serves as a reminder of the democratic values, justice, equality enshrined in the Constitution. It brings a moment to reaffirm the nation’s dedication to progress and development.</p>
       <h1>Independence Day 2024: Activities And Celebrations</h1>

The President of India hoists the flag at the Red Fort in Delhi, followed by a speech that highlights the nation’s achievements and goals. After the flag is hosted, the national anthem is sung with great pride and patriotism.</p>
       <p>Major towns and cities host parades featuring military personnel, school children and cultural performance. These parades often include displays of India’s rich heritage and achievements.

          <strong> Independence Day 2024: </strong>On August 15, 2024, India will commemorate its 78th Independence Day, a momentous occasion that marks the end and freedom from about 200 years of British colonial rule.

  <center><h1>Why 1944 is crucial in Indian independence movement</h1><br>
   <img src="./photos/tricolor/gandhi.webp" alt="ganthi" width="50%" class="img-fluid d-block"></center>
  <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
    Gandhi was in the prison at Poona (Aga Khan Palace). He suffered endless agony for the activities that the British did to crush the Quit India Movement.
    <br><br>
    The British Government charged Gandhi that he and his congress party were responsible for all violence and disorder in the Country. Beside Gandhi twelve top Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Vallabvai Patel, Govinda Ballabh Pant, Syed Mahmud, Acharya J.B. Kripalini, Sankar Rao Deo, Hare Krushna Mahatab, Prafulla Chandra Ghose, Pattabhi Sitaramaya, Asaf Ali and Acharya Narendra Dev continued to suffer in the Ahmadnagar Fort. The whole of Congress remained inside the prison. Jinnah found it a golden opportunity to win over his cause for creating Pakistan. The British Government stood firm behind Jinnah abiding their “Divide and Rule policy”. Gandhi being vexed with the treatment of the British Government decided to start another fast beginning from 10th February 1943 for three weeks. His condition became so grave that he was in a near death situation. Millions prayed for his life. Leading persons of the country sent appeals to Churchill to release him. But Churchill who was terribly afraid of Gandhi remained unmoved. Gandhi survived the entire fast.
    <br><br>
    The British Government also refused for any negotiation unless the “Quit India Policy” was disavowed. This attitude forced three members of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, Homy Modi, N.R. Sarkar and M.S. Aney to resign.The country meanwhile passed through worst economic conditions because of the war and the man made famine in some parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands of people died during this period.British Government remained callous even during this period of endless miseries. Lord Wavell the new Viceroy began his rule under depressing conditions from 20th October, 1943.At that time Gandhi was in the Aga Khan Palace. In February 1944 Kasturba Gandhi, the wife of Mahatma fell seriously ill. The Government was so heartless that they showed no human feelings towards her needs and desires while she was on death bed. Gandhi had to see her death on 22nd February in a helpless way that shocked him. Very soon he fell seriously ill. By early May the doctors expressed grave fear that he might die at any moment. The Government considered it a serious risk if Gandhi would die as a prisoner in British hands.
    <br><br>
    The Viceroy therefore ordered for the release of Gandhi on 6th May 1944 unconditionally. Gandhi recovered very quickly. His presence outside the jail generated a new hope in the minds of the people. He declared
    <br><br>

    <i><b>“The August resolution is still there, I cannot alter nor do I wish to alter a single comma in that resolution.”</b></i>

    <br><br>

    Common people as well as revolutionaries looked at him with high hope for a fresh directive. From outside India even Subhash Chandra Bose, who on a point differed from Gandhi’s principle appealed him over the radio in July 1944 with the words
    <br><br>
      <i><b>“Mahatmaji, For Indians outside India you are the creator of the present awakening in our country.India’s last war of independence has begun. Troops of Azad Hind Fauj are now fighting bravely on the soil of India and in spite of all difficulty and hardship they are pushing forward slowly but steadily Father of our nation. In this wholly war of India’s liberation we ask for your blessing and good wishes.”</b></i>
      <br><br>

      India was wasting time while the Japanese were knocking at her doors. Communal tension was rising. The political deadlock continued and India’s destiny seemed drifting to the land of the unknown. Prices were mounting up causing misery and wretchedness. Black marketers and profiteers operated in the open market and carried on their nefarious activities of money collection-in-spite of Government ordinances. Such was the picture of India in 1944.

    <h1 class="text-center">Flag Of India: Complete Journey of Indian National Tricolour</h1>
       <p>
         <strong>About National Flag:</strong>
   The National Flag of India has a horizontal strip of three colours including deep saffron (Kesaria) at the top, white in the middle, and dark green at the bottom. The ratio of the flag width to its length is 2:3. In the white band, at the centre, a Navi-blue wheel is there which represents the chakra.
   <img src="./photos/tricolor/History-National-Flag-of-India.webp" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="...">
   <strong>Do you know what these colours indicate?</strong><br>
   <ul>
     <li>
       The top saffron colour indicates the strength and courage of the country.
     </li>
     <li>The white middle band indicates peace and truth with Dharma Chakra.</li>
      <li>
       The green shows the fertility, growth, and auspiciousness of the land.
      </li>
      <li>
       The design of the wheel appears like the wheel on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. Its diameter is approximately the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes.
      </li>
   </ul> 
   Let us tell you that on 22 July 1947, the design of the National Flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India.
   
   </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Now, we shall study the evolution or Journey of the tricolour National Flag of India
    </strong><br>
    Several changes took place in our National Flag since its first inception. Through several vicissitudes, our National Flag evolution sailed to arrive at what it today is. We can say that it reflects the political developments in the nation. The historical milestones in the evolution of the National Flag are as follows:<br><br>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The evolution of the Indian flag dates back to the pre-independence era. In 1904-1906, the first Indian flag came into existence and it was made by an Irish disciple of Swami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita. After some time the flag came to be known as Sister Nivedita's flag. The flag is comprised of red and yellow colours. Red signified the freedom struggle and yellow, is a symbol of victory. In Bengali words "Bonde Matoram" was written. It also contained a figure of 'Vajra', the weapon of the god 'Indra', and a white lotus in the middle. The symbol 'Vajra' depicts strength and lotus purity.
      </li>

      <li>
        Another flag was also designed in 1906. It was a tricolour flag with three equal strips of blue at the top, yellow in the middle, and red at the lower. The blue strip consists of eight stars of slightly different shapes. The red strip had two symbols, one of the sun and the other of a star and a crescent moon. In the yellow strip, 'Vande Mataram' was written in the Devanagari script.
      </li>
      <li>
        On 7 August 1906, the first unofficial national flag in India have bee

n hoisted in the Parsee Bagan Square (Green Park) in Calcutta now Kolkata. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes of red, yellow, and green colour. It came to be known as 'Calcutta Flag or 'Lotus Flag'. In the middle of it is written Vande Matram. The red strip had two symbols, one of the sun and the other a crescent moon. The green strip had eight half-open lotuses on it. It is believed that the flag was designed by Sachindra Prasad Bose and Sukumar Mitra. Let us tell you that the unfurling of the flag was being observed as "boycott day" against the partition of Bengal and the flag was hoisted by Surendranath Banerjee to mark the unity of India.
      </li>
      <img src="./photos/tricolor/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="...">
      <li>
        On 22 August 1907, the flag was unfurled by Madam Cama at Stuttgart, Germany. It is believed that the flag was collectively designed by Madam Cama, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, and Shyamji Krishna Varma. The flag attained the status of the first Indian flag that was hoisted in a foreign land. It was also referred to as the "Berlin Committee flag". The flag was similar to the first flag except that the top strip. It also consists of three colours namely green at the top, golden saffron in the middle, and red colour at the bottom. 
      </li>
      <img src="./photos/tricolor/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="...">
      <li>
        In 1916 Pingali Venkaya also designed a flag after approval from Mahatma Gandhi. Pingali Venkaya was a writer and a geophysicist. Mahatma Gandhi told him to incorporate a charkha in the flag as a symbol of the economic regeneration of India. He created a flag from handspun yarn 'Khadi' and had two colours namely red and green and the 'Charkha' was drawn across them. But Mahatma Gandhi did not approve it. According to him, the red represented the Hindu community and the green Muslims, but the other communities of India were not represented in the flag.
      </li>

        In 1917, the Home Rule League adopted a new flag. Let us tell you that the Home Rule League was formed by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. It was the time when Dominion status was being demanded in India. The flag consists of the Union Jack at the top, near the hoist. The rest of the flag had five red and four blue strips. In the shape of the 'Saptarishi' constellation, it had seven stars. It consists of a crescent moon and a star at the top fly end. But this flag did not gain popularity among the masses.

        In the All India Congress Committee session which took place at Bezwada in 1921(now Vijayawada) an Andhra youth prepared a flag and took it to Gandhiji. The flag was made up of two colours red and green that represent the two major communities Hindus and Muslims. At that time Gandhiji suggested adding a white strip in the flag that will represent the other communities of India and the spinning wheel to symbolise the progress of the nation. We can say that the flag was unofficially adopted in 1921.

        In the history of the flag, 1931 year is important. This year, a resolution was passed of adopting a tricolour flag as our national flag. It consists of three colours including saffron, white, and green with Mahatma Gandhi's spinning wheel at the centre. It also stated that it bore no communal significance and was to be interpreted thus. Therefore, we can say that this flag was adopted in 1931.

        The Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 adopted it as Free India National Flag. After Independence, the colours and significance remained the same. Only the change that took place was instead of the spinning wheel, the Dharma Chakra of Emperor Ashoka was adopted as the emblem of the national flag. Eventually, the tricolour flag of the Congress Party became the tricolour flag of Independent India.

    <strong> What is Flag Code?</strong><br>
    The Flag Code of India was modified on 26 January 2002 and after several years of independence; Indian citizens were finally allowed to hoist the flag of India over their homes, offices, and factories on any day and not just the National days as was the case earlier. According to the flag code, any Indian can proudly display the national flag anywhere and anytime, but should not disrespect the tricolour. Therefore, the Flag Code of India, 2002, has been divided into three parts. In Part, I, a general description of the National Flag is given. In Part II, it is mentioned that the display of the National Flag members of the public, private organisations, educational institutions, etc. In Part III, the display of the National Flag by Central and State Governments and their organisations and agencies. Let us tell you that there are some rules and regulations on how to fly the flag according to the 26 January 2002 legislation.

               India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
